# Development-Only Stability Checks

Reselect includes extra checks in development mode to help catch and warn about mistakes in selector behavior.

## `inputStabilityCheck`

Due to how [**_Cascading Memoization_**] works in Reselect, it is crucial that your [input selectors] do not return a new reference on each run. If an [input selector][input selectors] always returns a new reference, like

```ts
state => ({ a: state.a, b: state.b })
```

or

```ts
state => state.todos.map(todo => todo.id)
```

that will cause the selector to never memoize properly.
Since this is a common mistake, we've added a development mode check to catch this. By default, [`createSelector`] will now run the [input selectors] twice during the first call to the selector. If the result appears to be different for the same call, it will log a warning with the arguments and the two different sets of extracted input values.

```ts
type StabilityCheckFrequency = 'always' | 'once' | 'never'
```

| Possible Values | Description                                     |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `once`          | Run only the first time the selector is called. |
| `always`        | Run every time the selector is called.          |
| `never`         | Never run the input stability check.            |

:::info

The input stability check is automatically disabled in production environments.

:::

You can configure this behavior in two ways:

### 1. Globally through `setInputStabilityCheckEnabled`:

A `setInputStabilityCheckEnabled` function is exported from Reselect, which should be called with the desired setting.

```ts
import { setInputStabilityCheckEnabled } from 'reselect'

// Run only the first time the selector is called. (default)
setInputStabilityCheckEnabled('once')

// Run every time the selector is called.
setInputStabilityCheckEnabled('always')

// Never run the input stability check.
setInputStabilityCheckEnabled('never')
```

### 2. Per selector by passing an `inputStabilityCheck` option directly to [`createSelector`]:

  <!-- START: development-only-stability-checks/per-selector.ts -->

<Tabs
  groupId='language'
  defaultValue='ts'
  values={[
    {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
    {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value='ts'>

```ts title="development-only-stability-checks/per-selector.ts"
import { createSelector } from 'reselect'

interface RootState {
  todos: { id: number; completed: boolean }[]
  alerts: { id: number; read: boolean }[]
}

// Create a selector that double-checks the results of input selectors every time it runs.
const selectCompletedTodosLength = createSelector(
  [
    // This input selector will not be memoized properly since it always returns a new reference.
    (state: RootState) =>
      state.todos.filter(({ completed }) => completed === true)
  ],
  completedTodos => completedTodos.length,
  // Will override the global setting.
  { inputStabilityCheck: 'always' }
)
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='js'>

```js title="development-only-stability-checks/per-selector.js"
import { createSelector } from 'reselect'

// Create a selector that double-checks the results of input selectors every time it runs.
const selectCompletedTodosLength = createSelector(
  [
    // This input selector will not be memoized properly since it always returns a new reference.
    state => state.todos.filter(({ completed }) => completed === true)
  ],
  completedTodos => completedTodos.length,
  // Will override the global setting.
  { inputStabilityCheck: 'always' }
)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

  <!-- END: development-only-stability-checks/per-selector.ts -->

:::warning

This will override the global input stability check set by calling `setInputStabilityCheckEnabled`.
