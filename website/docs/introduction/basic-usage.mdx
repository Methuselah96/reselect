# Basic Usage

Reselect exports a `createSelector` API, which generates memoized selector functions. `createSelector` accepts one or more input selectors, which extract values from arguments, and a result function function that receives the extracted values and should return a derived value. If the generated output selector is called multiple times, the output will only be recalculated when the extracted values have changed.

You can play around with the following **example** in [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/reselect-example-g3k9gf?file=/src/index.js):

```ts title="basic-usage.js"
import { createSelector } from 'reselect'

interface RootState {
  todos: { id: number; completed: boolean }[]
  alerts: { id: number; read: boolean }[]
}

const state: RootState = {
  todos: [
    { id: 0, completed: false },
    { id: 1, completed: true }
  ],
  alerts: [
    { id: 0, read: false },
    { id: 1, read: true }
  ]
}

const selectCompletedTodos = (state: RootState) => {
  console.log('selector ran')
  return state.todos.filter(todo => todo.completed === true)
}

selectCompletedTodos(state) // selector ran
selectCompletedTodos(state) // selector ran
selectCompletedTodos(state) // selector ran

const memoizedSelectCompletedTodos = createSelector(
  [(state: RootState) => state.todos],
  todos => {
    console.log('memoized selector ran')
    return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed === true)
  }
)

memoizedSelectCompletedTodos(state) // memoized selector ran
memoizedSelectCompletedTodos(state)
memoizedSelectCompletedTodos(state)

console.log(selectCompletedTodos(state) === selectCompletedTodos(state)) //=> false

console.log(
  memoizedSelectCompletedTodos(state) === memoizedSelectCompletedTodos(state)
) //=> true
```

As you can see from the example above, `memoizedSelectCompletedTodos` does not run the second or third time, but we still get the same return value as last time.

In addition to skipping unnecessary recalculations, `memoizedSelectCompletedTodos` returns the existing result reference if there is no recalculation. This is important for libraries like React-Redux or React that often rely on reference equality checks to optimize UI updates.
